<h2>Unit 1, Outcome 2 - Review</h2>
<br>
<h3>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello </h3>
<br>
<p>For the Dev stage of my project the software tools I used were Trello and Visual Studio Code.
    <br>
    <br>
    Trello:
    <br>
    <br>
    When I got to use it eventually, Trello helped me out a great deal when dividing the different parts of the unit outcomes and then put all the components back together, sort of a jigsaw puzzle effect. It helps ernomosly when it comes to the layout of the research part. Having different cards with the different sections made the job of adding all the content into HTML.
    <br>
    <br>
    Visual Studio Code:
    <br>
    <br>
    Visual Studio Code was really easy to learn, although I had already used the full version of visual studio in our earlier project. it can be a bit tricky and needs you to actually put in the commands most of the time. This is time consuming, like in this project for me when making the nav bar setting the html tags for header and footer this ate up about 10% of the dev time as I kept running into errors.
</p>
<h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello</h3>
<p>
    
    Using Trello, was useful as it introduced me to more current industry standards of teamwork management. It also allowed me to showcase my source code and progress. It allowed me to properly plan out my work so I could be in more control -  Although I could have relied on its use much more than I did.
    <br>
    <br>
    In using Visual Cose, as I stated earlier, I believe I have access to the full version. so I felt that as this was a simple editor it was lacking making me have to do the heavy lifting (i.e. having to input the nav, body and header tags myself.). 
    
    In the frontend, if you were to make a dynamic website you would still need to use HTML and CSS. Libraries like React use CSS and HTML. So, the reality of it is that there is no other replacement for structuring and styling the frontend of your website.
<br>
<br>

    I didn't make much use of slack for this project as it was an individual project.
<br>
<br>

</p>
<h3> 2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change? </h3>
<p> 

The strengths of my website:
<br>
<br>
This version of the site meets the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) criteria. Being quite a simplistic design, with it's light background and easy to ready text. Iit gives it a clean feel and helps the user navigate through the site easily. 
<br>
<br>
I feel as a creative individual I could have done more to it. 
It's rather basic and should have had more complex code (working in the background)

</p>

<h3>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h3>

<p> 
    Add more coding and features using different tools. example Use Bootstrap to make the website responsive for all devices. I did try in this project to reflect that but it did not work as it should have.
    <br>
    <br>
    Adding more links to show the projects I had worked on.


</p>


<h3>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose </h3>

<p>
    I did well in Planning and Researching what I needed to realise this project uunder it's constrains. However I did lose time in trying to perfect a few minor component, therefore losing time.
     
    Eventually using my Trello board more efficiently, I was able to compartmentalise each state of the task. This enabled me to come back on track for each component of the Project WebDev;
    I do believe my site meets the Minimum Viable Product as the site works. 

    Not having a pre programmed template, I realise how time consuming this process is and will schedule my time much better in future.
