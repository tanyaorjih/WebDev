<h2>About me....</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
       
<p>  
        Iam a fresh minded innovator and strategic thinker with in-depth knowledge and experience of Information      Technology/Customer service.
        <br>
        <br>
        <!-- <p> -->
        Having worked in different roles ranging from the Service Desk support to The Infrastructure team within an IT department, I have not had the opportunity to challenge myself, or to branch out into other areas of IT.
        For example Programming, until this opportunity arose with this programming school called:<p><a href="https://wearecodenation.com/">Code Nation.</a></p>
        
        Which I promptly grabbed with two hands!! Being here in CodeNation and aquired skills in PYTHON, HTML AND CSS has given me the great platform to launch into this new career path which I am looking forward to. I intend to train more to hone the skills I have aquired and welcome any aprentiship to help me get there.
        <br>
        <br>
        I enjoy the challenge of working to tight deadlines on numerous projects with a strong determination to succeed. I also hold a Batchelor of Arts degree in Textile Technology and Design. I am Imaginative, logical and a highly analytical person, who enjoys using my own initiative to prioritise workload or tasks. A good team player, with superb interpersonal and communication qualities.
        <br>
        <br>
        I enjoy hobbies like Drawing designs, painting, being creative with various mediums, Travelling, Floral arrangements-I have designed a few floral sets for various types of functions which I am proud of. I also love interating with new people as I believe everyday is a learning curve.
        <br>
        <br>
        Being Artistic and Imaginative has enabled me be creative in terms of using these programing and graphic tools to achieve my design for my website and also to produce the story board for our Python Game. I believe both skills compliment each other.
