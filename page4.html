<h2>Unit 1, Outcome 3</h2>
    <br>
<h3>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of 
    productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your 
    website? How? Could you have done it in teams? 
</h3>
    <br>
<p>In making this website and being my first attempt, I did struggle a bit with different components. 
    I am not that satisfied with the finished product, as I believe I could have used more effective coding tools to enable efficiencey and time wastage reduced. 
    <br>
    <br>   
    On this project I do not think it would have been nessary for a team collaboration, as it's only a personal web blog. Although I probably could have learnt more from my colleagues who are more proficient than I am. For future large projects yes. I am not profficient in this language, but maybe the use of javascript to make my code more flexible.
    <br>
    <br>
     If this was a team project depending on the strength of the team members certain aspects of the production could have been handed over and excecuted. Teams and Jupyter notebooks could be used in that regard to enable collaboration.
</p>

<h3>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency </h3>
<p>
    Productivity and efficiency - These are two separate tasks that usually seem to go hand in hand. Productivity is achieved by completing tasks or mile stones in a short period of time and being efficient means finding the best was of doing a particular task in relation to a given constrain
    <br>
    <br>

    List of ways to improve productivity include;
    <br>
    <br>
    Write relevant code into modules that can be quickly reused.
    <br>
    <br>
    Assigning your time to the most relevant tasks.
    <br>
    <br>
    Investing time in yourself by continuously learning and keeping up-to-date.
    <br>
    <br>
    Taking breaks as often as possible in order to rewire your brain’s synapsis to reduce the possibility of burn out.
</p>

<h3>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h3>
<p>
    One of the ways, I will approach this differently is by planning the website using the software development lifecycle approach. Design this on photoshop as I have seen a lot of web devs do to make it easier to visualise the website. allocate components if there is a team. Learn about other technologies or approaches which can help.
    <br>
    <br> 
    I would work in a team that gives the ability to bring different ideas and manage workload using Trello - as this has been tried and tested.  Use slack to communicate and with Github to share code if working on a team like we did on our python project. 
</p>
<h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions </h3>
<p>
    Given the nature of the project the two least resource intensive way of testing the website was Alpha Testing and betta testing.
    <br>
    <br>
    Alpha Testing: This type of testing is when the developer goes through each component of the website making functionality checks, making sure things like the page adjust when the browser frame is resized.
    <br>
    <br>  
    Betta Testing: At its core this is getting someone else to use your product in order in order to see what works and what those not.
    <br>
    <br>
    I tested the website by conducting the Alpha testing in the Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge (internet explorer) browser and all functionality works
