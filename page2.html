<h2>Unit 1, Outcome 1</h2>
    <br>
<h3>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h3>
    <br>
<p>Technology (or IT) is defined as “the application of computers and internet to store, retrieve, transmit, and manipulate data, or information.”

    From small businesses run by a single person to huge multi-national corporations, the importance of information technology in any business setting is evident. Computer technology is used across the business world in every department and has become vital to business operations in the modern world. Without information technology and system support, businesses simply stop! If the internet or phone service goes down, nothing can get done — HR, finance, operations, communications, sales, and all other departments depend on functional computer and information systems to complete their work. Plus, IT and Information Services (or IS) protect the integrity of data and keep it safe from a world of technological threats.
    <br>
    <br>
    Information technology fosters innovation in modern business, which results in smarter apps, improved data storage, faster processing, and wider information distribution.
    <br>
    <br>
     
    Innovation in IT makes businesses run more efficiently. This increases value, enhances quality, and boosts productivity. Innovation through information technology has created the following radical changes in business: 
    <br>
    <br>
    
    • Online shopping is more efficient than shopping in a store. 
    <br>
    <br>
    • Digital marketing is more efficient than high cost newspaper, television, and radio advertising.
     <br>
    <br>
    • Social networking is more efficient than going to clubs. • VoiP communication is more efficient than legacy telephony.
     <br>
    <br>
    • Cloud computing is more efficient than a private computer network. Businesses that have embraced the innovation paradigm tend to have the following characteristics:
    <br>
    <br>
     • They have more accurate business planning
     <br>
    <br>
    • They have more effective marketing 
    <br>
    <br>
    • They have higher global sales 
    <br>
    <br>
    • They have more systematic management
     <br>
    <br>
    • They use real time monitoring
     <br>
    <br>
    • They offer instant customer support 
    <br>
    <br>
    It’s hard to think of long term business growth without the push of information technology. 
    <br>
    <br>
    5 Reasons for Accelerated Business Growth The technological revolution has improved businesses this century in the following five primary ways: 
    <br>
    <br>
    1. Information technology has given business the tools to solve complex problems. Improved hardware (more memory, faster processors, sharper visual displays, etc.) combined with smarter applications (Mindmapping software like X Mind, collaborative software like Trello - Kanban boards, organisers like Google calendar, etc.) have made it easier to research data, analyse it, and plan scalability. Many tools are now available to solve complex problems.
    <br>
    <br>
    2. Information technology allows businesses to make better decisions. Good decisions in business are based on solid market research. This can be done through engaging teams through video conferences, reviewing public sentiment on social media and industry forums, and using online surveys to get customer feedback. There are also tools like Microsoft CRM Dynamics and Google Analytics. 
    <br>
    <br>
    3. Information technology has improved marketing. Internet marketing using online advertising methods (SEO, PPC, Facebook Ads) are far more accurate ways than traditional marketing of finding target audiences, discovering their needs, and building a marketing campaign to persuade them to buy. It’s difficult to see how many people read a newspaper ad. These days it’s easy to figure out how many people clicked on an online banner. 
    <br>
    <br>
    
    4. Information technology has improved customer support. Customers can receive support from multiple channels telephone, emails, social media platforms, webinars, and so on. Additionally, customer relationship management systems help businesses understand customer behaviour. 
    <br>
    <br>
    
    5. Information technology has improved resource management. Cloud computing allows a company’s employees to use any device anywhere in the world to access their enterprise level software. If the purpose of business is to increase profits, then innovation is the way to make more profits, faster. The story of Jan Koum gives us a clue how much big businesses value innovation. He went from food stamps to billionaire because of his invention of WhatsApp.
    <br>
    <br>
    
    
    The more obvious example is our online course with Code Nation which had to be implemented due to the Corona virus Lockdown. IT has made available the tools to enable successful Today’s technological advancements make online learning available, convenient and easier than ever. Connecting with instructors and students is as easy as opening your laptop and logging on using tools such as Zoom and Slack. 
    <br>
    <br>
    
    Online databases full of any information you need and new virtual platforms allow students to engage with the material in new and exciting ways. In short, workplaces cannot function without IT and IS professionals. They’re a valuable part of every office and business environment.

<h3>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h3>

<p>The skills, method and resources needed would depend on the task the person was trying to complete
    so now it comes to the point where, once we have defined how to plan ahead a nice proceeding to carry out our project, chosen the tools that can help us out when dividing tasks, and we have the fundamental skills (either individual or within a team) needed to make it happen it's time to decide how we should carry out our project depending on the task at hand.
    So when it comes to deciding the adequate technology that would better fit, some people tend to either be subjective (own personal experience, referrals) or uninformed (a similar project has been carried out in a certain manner that in some cases may not fit the one they are working on).
    <br>
    <br>
    When approaching this question you need to be realistic and objective about your project. You need to determine the size and type of the project and it's complexity. When it comes to it, usually IT projects are divided into three groups
        
    Simple: (business sites, small online stores) where the complexity it's not very high and most of the functions are already implemented in the platform that provides the web service. Obviously, this comes with huge restrictions on their functionality and appearance.
</p>
<h3> 1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT </h3>
<p> 
    The process falls into different stages like; 
    <br>
    <br>
    Research: This has many layers including looking at other websites of other entities in the same space. Observing their layout and other features that you find interesting.
    <br>
    <br>
     
    Story-boarding: This is the next process, after you have completed the research and have decided what to do and how it’s going to look. At this stage if there were external stakeholders or a client. The story-boarding would need to be presented at the next meeting.
    <br>
    <br>
    The Dev stage: This is the point in time when “the rubber hits the road ” where you have to start writing code for the website itself.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    So now it comes to the point where, once we have defined how to plan ahead a nice proceeding to carry out our project, chosen the tools that can help us out when dividing tasks, and we have the fundamental skills (either individual or within a team) needed to make it happen, it's time to decide how we should carry out our project depending on the task at hand. 
    <br>
    <br>
    After The dev and review stage as been completed we would then consider hosting, domain name and best hosting site. There are number of possibilities for customising your website, and in order to not lose track of what needs to be done first. 
    <br>
    <br>
    You can use Trello as we have referenced before, to layout the different task that need to be carried out in an orderly manner. As covered in section 1.2 what makes digital projects to succeed, what tools can help to carry out the project and what skills are usually needed in order to face certain complications during the development phase. So when we ask ourselves what makes digital projects to fail, we can get to the conclusion that: Even though it's a digital project first and foremost it's a business initiative, so it's very likely that without a well thought out business management plan that can adjust the digital scope towards it's actual goal, the project is destined to bump into many unexpected inconveniences and fail eventually. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Also good project planning can help to intervene in case the project gets stuck in a certain part of the development process, so tweaks or alternative solutions may be reached to keep it running. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Lack of communication between company departments: Over the last sections we talked about how communication is vital to make a project run. This becomes even more important when the project requires several departments to work together or depend on one another. One can say, the digital part of the process is the channel from which the idea of the project is carried out.
     <br>
    <br>
    These are common problems that an inadequate understanding of business process may cause, so having a flexible project that can react to problems and a broad scope of all the perspectives that have to be considered can help avoid total disaster.
    <br>
    <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>    
</p>

<h3>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</h3>
<p> First, digital projects are inherently a risky proposition. A lot fail. It’s natural. Part of this is just the nature of innovation — They say, “you have to make a lot of rubbish to get something good”.
    <br>
    <br>
    And as technology becomes more closely entwined with every aspect of a business, digital projects require more planning, more collaboration, and more buy-in than ever before. Beyond collaboration, there are a few specific risks worth looking out for when it comes to digital projects: 
    <br>
    <br>
    • Ignoring business processes.
    <br>
    <br>
    • Failing to secure complete executive buy-in.
    <br>
    <br>
    
    • Investing in sizzle instead of solving business objectives or improving customer experiences.
    <br>
    <br>
     
    • Poor project definition / expectation setting.
    <br>
    <br>
    
    • Bad vendor selection Human error - Mistakes can be made Although these are the risks, there are lots of things you can do, to make your digital project go off without a hitch.
    <br>
    <br>
     
    • You can push to the cloud or do offline live mode • • • •

    <br>
</p>

<h3>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h3>
<p>As we all know that the tools needed depends on the task being undertaken. For this project the tools needed are already mentioned above. However before starting off on the project one must strategically plan out what needs to be done (as seen in 1.3).
    <br>
    <br>
    The next step would then looking at the business behind the site and their scale / size. This would then influence the type of website to be made to cope with their type of clients. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Companies generally fall under one or more of the following; 
    <br>
    <br>
    Simple:(business sites, small online stores) Where the complexity is not very high and most of the functions are already implemented in the platform that provides the web service. Obviously, this comes with huge restrictions on their functionality and appearance. This is where my website falls under.
     <br>
    <br>
    Medium: (larger online stores, national-scale portals...) Such projects are usually built around frameworks, which are a functional block with predefined features, which increases the speed rate of the project but will probably come with some limitations when it comes to implementing features, but it will always be cheaper than using a High Level programming code.
    <br>
    <br>
    Large: Such as social networks, where the project's core is developed in a high level (HL) programming language and the need for functionality, flexibility and data exchange are at the highest level. So depending not only on the scale of the project, but also the features you want to implement into it you can then identify how to tackle your project.

<h3>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes.</h3>

<p>In my view Trello is a software that helps you platfrom a number of agile ceremonies such as the sprint and listing the project backlog.The solution's "Kanban methodology helps with this. 
    <br>
    <br>
    This is the same methodology I Implemented this project in. I divided the different sections of my assignment into smaller tasks. That becomes very handy when it comes to facing any assignment, and can also be used to share information of the project process to members of a team if working with a group.
    <br>
    <br> 
    Slack was really useful to maintain contact with the members of my team. Not all of us had exchanged phone numbers, so in order to inform of any changes while we were not together, or to make important decisions that needed to be made as soon as possible, we used this app to do so in our other project. Gith with regards to keeping track of your source code in my opinion Githhub is better it aids with version management.

<h3>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects. </h3>
<br>

<p>
What is the GDPR? It means the General Data Protection Regulations 2016 that came into the effect on 25th May 2018 for the protection of the personal data of members of the European Union (EU including the UK, even after Brexit. It says how personal data of citizens of the EU should be used or transferred outside the EU and it requires everyone to comply with its principles when using the data of an individual. 
<br>
<br>
This regulation introduced some changes to how data is handled, requiring digital projects to consider and contemplate data protection requirements at an early stage of any project, build in the necessary controls to ensure compliance with the GDPR. This is referred to as Data Protection by Design and Data Protection by Default. This regulation has been implemented in all local privacy laws across the entire EU and EEA region.
<br>
<br>
    It applies to all companies selling to and storing personal information about citizens in Europe, including companies on other continents. Expansion made under the GDPR includes; The right to access –this means that individuals have the right to request access to their personal data and to ask how their data is used by the company after it has been gathered.

    The company must provide a copy of the personal data, free of charge and in electronic format if requested. 
    <br>
    <br>
    The right to be forgotten – if consumers are no longer customers, or if they withdraw their consent from a company to use their personal data, then they have the right to have their data deleted.
    <br>
    <br>
    The right to data portability – Individuals have a right to transfer their data from one service provider to another. And it must happen in a commonly used and machine readable format. 
    <br>
    <br>
    The right to be informed – this covers any gathering of data by companies, and individuals must be informed before data is gathered. Consumers have to opt in for their data to be gathered, and consent must be freely given rather than implied. 
    <br>
    <br>
    The right to have information corrected – this ensures that individuals can have their data updated if it is out of date or incomplete or incorrect. 
    <br>
    <br>
    The right to restrict processing – Individuals can request that their data is not used for processing. Their record can remain in place, but not be used.
    <br>
    <br>
     
    The right to object – this includes the right of individuals to stop the processing of their data for direct marketing. There are no exemptions to this rule, and any processing must stop as soon as the request is received. In addition, this right must be made clear to individuals at the very start of any communication.
     <br>
    <br>
    The right to be notified – If there has been a data breach which compromises an individual’s personal data, the individual has a right to be informed within 72 hours of first having become aware of the breach. The expansion was the union’s way of giving individuals, prospects, customers, contractors and employees more power over their data and less power to the organisations that collect and use such data for monetary gain. 
    <br>
    <br>
    This regulation introduced some changes to how data is handled, requiring digital projects to consider and contemplate data protection requirements at an early stage of any project, build in the necessary controls to ensure compliance with the GDPR. 
    <br>
    <br>
    This is referred to as Data Protection by Design and Data Protection by Default. 
    <br>
    <br>
    The above data protection requirements should be taken into account when building digital projects, however, issues may arise when they've been missed initially and are being considered at a later stage of the project. These issues should be considered during the Planning, Design and Development stages of the project. It will be advisable and necessary to consult the relevant data protection and Information security teams to help comply.
