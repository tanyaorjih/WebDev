<h2>Unit 2, Outcome 1 - Website Software</h2>
 <br>
<h3>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h3>
 <br>
<p>
    Starting with my home page, I have my navigation bar situated on top of a banner. For all the pages I have created a fixed navigation to enable the user easy access throughout the website. The navigation blocks have a transition on hovering over each one, with a different background color: orange showing and when on a page highlighted without hover transition to indicate the page the user is on. I have created a footer with copyright attached to it. I also added a button More about me..using HTML to link from the middle of the page to open the About me page.
    <br>
    <br>
    The Banner and the backround images were both sourced from different locations. The Banner depicting the creative side of me and the Lady in the background the adventurous and fun side. I loved the colours which are warm and calming, hence I chose a contrasting shade for the background colour to enhance the pictures and Text. 
    In the middle of the page I have situated the “about me…” and the “More about me” button which is linked to page 3 on the Navigation bar.
<br>
<br>
    For my Outcome/Review pages, I kept simple, using basic HTML5 for readability and navigation purposes, from page to page this would appeal to anyone especially, if challenged mentally, physically or by sight - unfortunately I am unable to use 'Screen Readers' in this website for now, as it is advanced for this project and myself presently. Hopefully will be doing that in my next project... The Text color: dark blue against the light background color gives contrast. I also Increased the Font sizes of the Unit questions and the rest of the text to make for easy read. The text all incased in boxes mostly for esthetic appeal.
<br>
<br>
    On every page I have the footer with the copyright attached to them.
    </p>

<h3>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h3>

<p>
    Licenses are granted by an authority to allow a usage; in my case, the use and distribution of resources by the copyright owner (i.e. me). I may decide to offer my photograph for free or charge a price; either way, I can include a license to limit usage, and I maintain the copyright. Just because someone pays money doesn’t mean they have full control or rights to what they’re buying.
    <br>
    <br>
    What Is “Fair Use?
    ”“Fair use” is an exception to the exclusive rights held by the copyright owner. It exists in some countries such as the US and UK. Under it, in certain cases, using work without permission is possible. If someone’s usage is defined as fair use, then they don’t need to obtain a license. Essentially, using copyrighted material is a legal right. Examples of fair use might include:
    <br>
    <br>
    
    Educational purposes, such as teaching and student research;
    <br>
    <br>
    Making commentary and criticism as part of a news report or published article. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Copyright - Creative artist's control of original work: the legal right of creative artists or publishers to control the use and reproduction of their original works. You have to have permission before using it.
    <br>
    <br>
    Licensing - Permission to use something for your own reasons. e.g if you have authorization to use something like a song or an image. .
</p>
<h3> 1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</h3>

<p>
    "It's difficult, if not impossible, to design generically for all disabilities," Wasserman says. "Within the main categories of disability — sensory, physical and cognitive — there is such wide variation, so it's important to understand your users first." If you're passionate about making the most accessible site possible, try to get a physical read on how someone with disabilities actually goes online. You have to know your audience.
    <br>
    <br> 

    Use yourself as an example. Download a screen reader, like Google's free ChromeVox, and learn first hand how assistive technology works. The experience will inform you on your journey to designing a more disability-friendly website.
    <br>
    <br>
    Use alt tags: When you hover your mouse over an image on a website, the little words that pop up are called alt tags. For someone who has a visual impairment and uses a screen reader (a software program that reads text on a website out loud), the alt tags are read aloud, and are the only way a user knows what the image is. Take alt tags seriously and use them as an opportunity to describe the image accurately and succinctly. If it’s a picture of a person, write out the person’s name. If it’s an object, use a couple of words to describe it (for example, if it’s a photo of pile of bricks, use the alt text "pile of bricks").
    <br>
    <br>
    Create subtitles and transcripts: If your web content regularly includes videos, try to provide subtitles — especially if you’re producing the bulk of your own video content. Popular video hosting sites such as YouTube have tools that allow users to add subtitles to their clips. Making a transcription of the video available online is also an incredibly helpful resource for users.
    <br>
    <br>
    Put periods in abbreviations: If you're abbreviating something in HTML, put periods in between each letter. For example, if you're referencing the Central Intelligence Agency, write it out as C.I.A., rather than CIA. A screen reader won't recognize the abbreviation without periods, and will instead read it out phonetically as a word (C-I-A will be read as "cia").
    <br>
    <br>
    Describe your links: When embedding a link in a post, it's more useful to describe the link, rather than just telling the reader to "click here." For example, it's better to write out, "To learn more about technology, check out Mashable's tech channel" instead of "To learn more about technology, click here." Whenever possible, underline your links or make sure that there is a color contrast between hyperlinked text and regular text. That way, colorblind users will able to find a link immediately without having to hover over it with their cursors.
    <br>
    <br>
    Utilize color control: Practicing smart color choices is useful for a website with any kind of audience. Avoid pairing garish colors, and be wary of using yellow, blue and green close to one another (this is especially difficult for colorblind users). Black text on a white background is the best general practice, because it's readable for most audiences.
    <br>
    <br>
    Get clickable: For users with mobility problems, it can be difficult to click on small items within a tiny clickable range. It’s like trying to nail a bullseye every single time you play a game of darts. Give the clickable item a wider range so the user can click on it within the item's general area. There are plenty of available guides for how to create this in code, like this how-to from Webcredible.
    <br>
    <br>
    Keep your copy simple: This tip is helpful for any audience, but is imperative for elderly audiences or those with learning disabilities. If you're putting a lot of text onto your website, break it into smaller paragraphs. Use simple, straightforward language in the active voice. Naturally, this might not work for all sites, depending on the content, but you can apply it to various pages (such as an "About" or "History" section).
    <br>
    <br>
    Include an accessibility guide: If you've done your best to make your site disability-friendly, include a section that lays out all of the ways your site is accessible. Alternatively, you can post a guide on tips and tricks users can implement on their own computers.

<h3>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate ﬁletypes for websites</h3>
<br>

<p>There are different filetypes for making websites on the internet but I have come up with some of the most commonly used ones:
    <br>
    <br> 
    Internet File Formats AVI — Audio/Video Interleaved - mp3 files for audio and mp4 files for video
    <br>
    <br> 
    CSS — Cascading StyleSheet. 
    <br>
    <br> 
    DOC — Microsoft Word DOCument.
    <br>
    <br> 
     
    EXE — EXEcutable file. 
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    GIF — Graphics Interchange Format. 
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    HTML/ . HTM — HyperText Markup Language file.
    <br>
    <br> 
     
    JPG/ . JPEG — Joint Photographic Experts Group file.
    <br>
    <br> 
     
    MIDI/ . MID — Musical Instrument Digital Interface. 
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    So far I have used HTML to structure the website and CSS  to style. They really create the layout, style and artistry of the various pages. My style is really simple at the moment but with more experience and time will hopefully become intricate and exciting. In my future projects I intend to try out using as many filetypes as I can, as I'm willing to learn as much as possible to succeed.
    <br>
    <br>
    Image File Formats - JPG, TIF, PNG, GIF, JPG and PNG  the most used image file format. I have added that to my website in form of the background and banner pictures. TIF is lossless (including LZW compression option), which is considered the highest quality format for commercial work. The ability to store image data in a lossless format makes a TIFF file a useful image archive, because, unlike standard JPEG files, a TIFF file using lossless compression (or none) may be edited and re-saved without losing image quality. ... Other TIFF options are layers and pages.
    <br>
    <br> 
    Images play an important role in the website. To look aesthetically  presentable, informative and enjoyable for the user.
